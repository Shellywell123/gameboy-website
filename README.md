# Gameboy project showcase website
This is a small website idea I had to make a portfolio that navigate like a gameboy and found that https://alexramalho.dev did exactly that!
I have since forked his awesome repo and began making some tweaks to get it closer to my own vision. 
I aim to make a DMG themed website that has links to all my various projects/games.

### Running locally
```
sudo chmod -R 777 gameboy && docker compose up
```
then visit `http://localhost:1234`
